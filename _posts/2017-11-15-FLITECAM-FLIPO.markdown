> Science lead for more than 30 of 50 total career flights aboard NASA's
  SOFIA, managing the instrument & scientific operations teams from proposals
  to in-flight operations; managed documentation, deliverables, and program
  requirements.

Instrument and Support Scientist for the First Light Infrared Test Experiment CAMera (FLITECAM), a facility instrument aboard NASA's Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). FLITECAM could be co-mounted with the High Speed Imaging Photometer for Occultations (HIPO) in a combined "FLIPO" mode, providing simultaneous optical and near-infrared imaging for transient events.

Key team member and general ring leader for FLITECAM and FLIPO flights, including onboard support for the dedicated observing campaigns of a Pluto occultation in New Zealand in June 2015 and a Triton occultation in October 2017.

Led FLITECAM (and to a lesser extent FLIPO) through commissioning and formal acceptance.
