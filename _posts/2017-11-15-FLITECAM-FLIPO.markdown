Instrument and Support Scientist for the First Light Infrared Test Experiment CAMera (FLITECAM), a facility instrument aboard NASA's Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). FLITECAM could be co-mounted with the High Speed Imaging Photometer for Occultations (HIPO) in a combined "FLIPO" mode, providing simultaneous optical and near-infrared imaging for transient events. Led FLITECAM through the formal commissioning and acceptance process.

Key team member and general ring leader for FLITECAM and FLIPO flights, including onboard support for the dedicated observing campaigns of a Pluto occultation in New Zealand in June 2015 and a Triton occultation in October 2017.
