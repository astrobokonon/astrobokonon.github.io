Hello! I'm a professional astronomer who likes building scientific instruments, working with software, and especially smashing those two together to make cool stuff. I'm decisive with a strong intuition for problem solving - it tickles my brain to solve complex technical and operational issues with telescopes, instrumentation, and everything in between. I can find solutions to fit any time frame while still pushing for impactful improvements rather than piles of band-aids. Values creativity, trust, participation, and humor.

I'm currently the Head of Instrumentation at Lowell Observatory. Before that I was an Instrument Scientist at Lowell.

Before Lowell, I was the Instrument Scientist during commissioning and acceptance for the High-resolution Airborne Wide Band Camera (HAWC+) on NASA's Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA).  I also was the Instrument Scientist for
FLITECAM/FLIPO, and originally started at SOFIA as a postdoc after I finished
my Ph.D. at New Mexico State University in 2013.
